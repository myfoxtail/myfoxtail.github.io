## Make emotions rain – the universal language of the comedy

<span class="half-content">The key visual of the infinitely changing photographs of people having different emotions expresses the essence of the comedy.
Whether it’s a book or a stand-up comedian, one thing never changes – it’s a constant challenge of simple things in life that draw various emotions, making one a different self.

## Concept development

<span class="half-content">The initial inspiration came from installation art of [Christian Boltanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Boltanski) 
found in one of the [Rigas Laiks](https://www.rigaslaiks.com/) magazines. From now on, it was a matter of setting up pictures conveying the right emotions. Indeed, Christian Boltanski got his spot,
along with an image from Dead of Night found on the cover of Bob Nickas book.

<span class="half-content">The established modular grid system allows to create limitless amount of variations of photo positions, inside an object (e.g. poster) and across many of them. 
This creates extra levels of movement and change. 
<br/><br/>The [English Egyptian](https://www.abyme.net/catalogue/englishegyptian/) typeface used in this project is an interpretation of William Caslon’s
Two Lines English Egyptian of 1816 (possibly the first general-purpose sans-serif typeface in the Latin alphabet known to have been created). This type brings earnestness and balance to the story
of bright colours and photographic interplays.
