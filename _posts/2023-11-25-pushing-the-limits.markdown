## Tell about music through aspects of Asian graphic design

<span class="half-content">The core visuals for the magazine cover and the article are inspired by Asian graphic design, 
which often minimises the use of rigid geometrical structure in favour of intuitive and organic structure. 
These concepts express humanity’s relation to nature, which can be seen through the aesthetics of music.

<span class="half-content">While exploring layouts and grids for a music magazine cover I studied lots of interesting grids of old science magazines.
That eventually brought me to use metronome as a concept to reflect the magazine name and purpose.
The magazine grid repeats the metronome scale. Additionally the name sits on the 5 first lines as if it’s a music notation.</span>

## How to design an article about jazz history that reflects the essence of the genre?
<span class="half-content">Jazz, as it is very well pointed in the article, is hard to pin down into any category due to it’s  unshakable characteristic – improvisation.
In my research for a concept I could not help but associate the genre with the nature of Chinese calligraphy. That gave me ideas on how to layout the article and which colours and typography to use throughout.

<span class="half-content">The inspiration for the jazz history timeline layout came from the ancient Chinese bamboo scrolls. This allowed to have a free-flowing effect being at the same time locked to the structure. Similar to what jazz is. Improvisation within system.
