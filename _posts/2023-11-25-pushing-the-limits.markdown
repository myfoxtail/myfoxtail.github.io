## Tell about music through aspects of Asian graphic design

<span class="half-content">The core visuals for the magazine cover and the article are inspired by Asian graphic design, 
which often minimises the use of rigid geometrical structure in favour of intuitive and organic structure. 
These concepts express humanity’s relation to nature, which can be seen through the aesthetics of music.

<span class="half-content">While exploring layouts and grids for a music magazine cover, many interesting grids of old science magazines came through.
Eventually, we used a metronome as a concept to reflect the magazine's name and purpose.</br>
The magazine grid repeats the metronome scale. Additionally, the name sits on the 5 first lines as if it's a musical notation.</span>

## How to design an article about jazz history that reflects the essence of the genre?
<span class="half-content">As it is very well pointed out in the article, jazz is hard to pin down into any category due to its unshakable characteristic – improvisation.
During the research for a concept, it helped to associate the genre with the nature of Chinese calligraphy. 
That gave further ideas on the layout of the article and which colours and typography to use throughout.

<span class="half-content">The jazz history timeline layout was inspired by the ancient Chinese bamboo scrolls. 
This allowed a free-flowing effect to be locked to the structure. Similar to what jazz is. Improvisation within the system.
