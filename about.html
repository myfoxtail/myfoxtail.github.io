<h2>To make the world a curious place to be</h2>

<p>SUNLIES is a small design den based in Sydney, Australia. It was created with a strong belief that design has an enormous power to make people more curious about the world.</p>

<p>SUNLIES is run by Alexandra Lui.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, she wakes up and brushes her teeth. At times, she may think of it on a global scale of waves of people waking up and brushing their teeth every single day as the Earth turns around. The sky's the limit.<p>

<p>Alex dedicates herself to studying and practising graphic design along with her long-lasting career as a software engineer, applying her passion for complex design systems, design theory and problem-solving.</p>

<p>If she could live two more lives in parallel, she would choose to be a neuroscientist and a journalist.</p>

<p>Alex has also been playing piano since she was 5 years old and writing songs as a way of expression. Production is relatively slow, but she tries to get it out there when she has time.
    You can check out <a href="https://sunlyse.com" target="_blank">this website</a>. She produces under the name Sunlyse.</p>
