<h3>Hi there</h3>

<p>I am an introvert and a passionate thinker. I see the world as fascinating and believe design has an enormous power to make people more curious about it.</p>

<p>I dedicate myself to studying and practising graphic design along with my long-lasting career as a software engineer, applying my enthusiasm for complex design systems, design theory and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Design is something I wanted to do since early days of my professional career. Even though I chose to focus and become a software engineer I always had a chance to get involved in the visual design in my work.
    In 2023 I took it seriously and got some ground knowledge by studying at Shillington.</p>

<p>If I could live two more lives in parallel, I would choose to be a neuroscientist and a journalist.
    I got into neurosciences a long ago after reading <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Humane_Interface.html?id=D39vjmLfO3kC&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">The Humane Interface</a> by Jef Raskin.
    As to journalism, I am more than fascinated by certain figures and teams in the world of journalism and the way they bring the truth out there and make the world better.
</p>

<p>I have been also playing piano since I was 5 years old and writing songs as a way of expression.
    Productionasing, however, is not my thing but I'm trying to get it out there when I have time. You can check out <a href="https://sunlyse.com" target="_blank">this website</a>. I produce under name Sunlyse.</p>

<h3>Do you want to talk or say hi?</h3>
<p>I am not very good at social media so the easiest way is to drop me an <a href="mailto:sunlies@pm.me">email</a> or reach out in Telegram at <a href="https://t.me/myfoxtail" target="_blank">@myfoxtail</a>. You can also ask me a question on <a href="https://github.com/myfoxtail/ama">github</a>.</p>
<p>I will set up Twitter one day.</p>

<h3>Why Sunlies?</h3>
<p>Well :)</p>
