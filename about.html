<h2>To make the world a curious place to be</h2>

<p>SUNLIES is a small studio run from Sydney, Australia. It was started with a strong believe that design has an enormous power to make people more curious about the world.</p>

<p>SUNLIES is run by Alexandra Lui.</p>

<p>She is an introvert and a passionate thinker. Alex dedicates herself to studying and practising graphic design along with her long-lasting career as a software engineer, applying her enthusiasm for complex design systems, design theory and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Design is something she wanted to do since early days of her professional career. Even though she chose to focus and become a software engineer she always had a chance to get involved in the visual design at work.</p>

<p>If Alex could live two more lives in parallel, she would choose to be a neuroscientist and a journalist.</p>

<p>Alex has also been playing piano since she was 5 years old and writing songs as a way of expression.
    Production is quite slow but she is trying to get it out there when she has time. You can check out <a href="https://sunlyse.com" target="_blank">this website</a>. She produces under the name Sunlyse.</p>
